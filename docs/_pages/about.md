Hello! I am a second year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) at the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligent Research (BAIR) Lab](http://bair.berkeley.edu/). I received my B.A.Sc in Engineering Physics from the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by Professors [Machiel Van der Loos](http://caris-mech.sites.olt.ubc.ca/profiles/machiel-van-der-loos/) and [Elizabeth Croft](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/elizabeth-croft) at the [Collaborative Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CARIS) Lab](https://caris.mech.ubc.ca/).

 My current interests involve developing algorithms that enable artificial agents, such as robots, to effectively interact with people in the real world. More broadly, I am curious about the challenges in real robot learning, facilitating collaboration and safe coexistence between artificial agents and humans, and understanding how agents can learn social behaviours and norms.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
